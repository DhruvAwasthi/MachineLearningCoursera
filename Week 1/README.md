**INTRODUCTION TO MACHINE LEARNING: LINEAR REGRESSION WITH ONE VARIABLE**

This week, I learned the core idea of teaching a computer to learn concepts using dataâ€”without being explicitly programmed.

I started out by covering linear regression with one variable. Linear regression predicts a real-valued output based on an input value. We discuss the application of linear regression to housing price prediction, present the notion of a cost function, and introduce the gradient descent method for learning.

I've also included the optional lessons that provide a refresher on linear algebra concepts.
