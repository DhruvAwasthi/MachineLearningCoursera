**TRAINING -  NEURAL NETWORKS**

In Week 5, I learned how to train Neural Networks. The Neural Network is one of the most powerful learning algorithms (when a linear classifier doesn't work, this is what I usually turned to), and this week's videos explained the 'backpropagation' algorithm for training these models. In this week's programming assignment, I also get to implement this algorithm and see it work for myself.
