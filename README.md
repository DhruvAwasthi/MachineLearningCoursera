**STANFORD - MACHINE LEARNING**

This repository shows my three months journey, and contains the solution of popular Machine Learning course on Coursera by Stanford University taught by instructor Andrew Ng, CEO/Founder Landing AI; Co-founder, Coursera; Adjunct Professor, Stanford University; formerly Chief Scientist,Baidu and founding lead of Google Brain.

Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. In the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress towards human-level AI. In this class, you will learn about the most effective machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting them to work for yourself. More importantly, you'll learn about not only the theoretical underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new problems. Finally, you'll learn about some of Silicon Valley's best practices in innovation as it pertains to machine learning and AI.

This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include:
(i)   Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks).
(ii)  Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning).
(iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI).

 The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.


**Projects done:**
1. During week 2, I implemented linear regression with one variable and multiple variables to predict the price of houses.
2. During week 3:

    (i)  I built a logistic regression model to predict whether a student gets admitted into a university.

    (ii) I implemented regularized logistic regression to predict whether microchips from a fabrication plant passes quality assurance (QA).
3. During week 4, I implemented one-vs-all logistic regression and neural networks to recognize hand-written digits.
4. During week 5, I implemented the back propagation algorithm for neural networks and apply it to the task of hand-written digit recognition.
5. During week 6:

    (i)  I implemented regularized linear regression and use it to study models with different bias-variance properties.

    (ii) I implemented polynomial regression technique to combat underfitting (high bias).
6. During week 7, I used support vector machine (SVM) to build my own spam classifier.
7. During week 8:

    (i)  I implemented the K-means clustering algorithm and apply it to compress an image.

    (ii) I used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to perform dimensionality reduction.
8. During week 9:

    (i)  I implemented the anomaly detection algorithm and apply it to detect failing servers on a network.

    (ii) I implemented the collaborative filtering learning algorithm and apply it to a dataset of movie ratings.
