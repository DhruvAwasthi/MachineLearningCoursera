**UNSUPERVISED LEARNING: CLUSTERING & PCA**

This week, I learned about unsupervised learning. While supervised learning algorithms need labeled examples (x,y), unsupervised learning algorithms need only the input (x). I learned about clusteringâ€”which is used for market segmentation, text summarization, among many other applications.

I also learned Principal Components Analysis, which is used to speed up learning algorithms, and is sometimes incredibly useful for visualizing and helping you to understand your data.
