**PHOTO OPTICAL CHARACTER RECOGNITION (OCR)**

This week, I went through a complex, end-to-end application of machine learning, to the application of Photo OCR. Identifying and recognizing objects, words, and digits in an image is a challenging task. I learned how a pipeline can be built to tackle this problem and how to analyze and improve the performance of such a system.
