**IMPROVING THE LEARNING ALGORITHM**

In Week 6, I learned about systematically improving the learning algorithm. The videos for this week taught me how to tell when a learning algorithm is doing poorly, and describe the 'best practices' for how to 'debug' the learning algorithm and go about improving its performance.

I also covered machine learning system design. To optimize a machine learning algorithm, we need to first understand where the biggest improvements can be made. In these lessons, I understoodd the performance of a machine learning system with multiple parts, and also how to deal with skewed data.
