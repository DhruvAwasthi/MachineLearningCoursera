**CLASSIFICATION - LOGISTIC REGRESSION**

This week, I covered logistic regression. Logistic regression is a method for classifying data into discrete outcomes. For example, we might use logistic regression to classify an email as spam or not spam. In this module, I came across the notion of classification, the cost function for logistic regression, and the application of logistic regression to multi-class classification.

I also covered regularization. Machine learning models need to generalize well to new examples that the model has not seen in practice. Regularization helps prevent models from overfitting the training data.
