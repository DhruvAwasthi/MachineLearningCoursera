**LINEAR REGRESSION with MULTIPLE VARIABLES**

This week, I covered linear regression with multiple variables. I learned how linear regression can be extended to accommodate multiple input features. I also came to know the best practices for implementing linear regression.

I went over how to use Octave. I worked on programming assignments designed to help me understand how to implement the learning algorithms in practice. To complete the programming assignments, you I used Octave but you can use MATLAB as well.
