**ANOMALY DETECTION and RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS**

This week, I covered anomaly detection which is widely used in fraud detection (e.g. ‘has this credit card been stolen?’). Given a large number of data points, we may sometimes want to figure out which ones vary significantly from the average. For example, in manufacturing, we may want to detect defects or anomalies. We show how a dataset can be modeled using a Gaussian distribution, and how the model can be used for anomaly detection.

I also covered recommender systems, which are used by companies like Amazon, Netflix and Apple to recommend products to their users. Recommender systems look at patterns of activities between different users and different products to produce these recommendations. In these lessons, I learned recommender algorithms such as the collaborative filtering algorithm and low-rank matrix factorization.
